### Mose from pseudoDB to MongoDB


## Big Picture Roadmap:

### Implementation improvement plan for game:

1. Simple form - type in correct answers using all English letters
2. Add timer
3. Add Fastest Time (records and display)
4. Add Legend/Key screen that removes/blocks form while open but does not stop timer
5. Add user accounts
6. Add functionality to do two languages at a time
    - For example, so you can see/hear Hindi and Urdu next to each other, or Urdu and Arabic next to each other
7. Move from form format to picture tagging format
    - Build Front End
8. Move from using all English letters to native characters
    - Probably add HTML support for more languages
9. Add sound bites that users can click on to hear pronunciations of the words
