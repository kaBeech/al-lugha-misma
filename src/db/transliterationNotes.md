DOUBLE CHECK THE 3IN IN ARABIC WORDS IN DB!!!! I feel like I may have rendered it as '/a in the colors section

-----Transliteration Notes-----
(Notes only provided in cases where the language is today most commonly printed in a non-Latin-based script, or the native spelling (including diacritics) is changed in some way)

Arabic:
    - One exception is the cedilla, which I rendered as an "s" instead of a "c"
        - It's  pronounced the way you'd expect (like the ")
HIGHLY VARIABLE!!

* ' - Glottal Stop

* j - Measuring the Gorge in George
    - "j" in "judge," "j" in "jump" or "g" in "gold"

* th - 
    - "th" in "think"

* H - 

* kh -

* dh -

* r - Trill or Tap
    - A tap is often made in English when saying the word 'butter' really fast
        - The 'tt' is where the tap happens!
    - Trills are commonly known as "rolled r's"
    - Taps and trills are also how r's are pronounced in Spanish!
        - An example of a tap is in "pero" (translation: "but")
        - An example of a trill is in "perro" (translation:"dog")

* 3 - Vocal Frye
    - "no, I'm good" -> "na3amgud"
    - "know what I'm saying" -> "na3msayin"

* gh -

* q - 

* S, T, D, DH - Pharyngealization - Tighten your throat
    - 'sat' might sound to an English speaker like 'set'
    - 'SaT' might sound to an English speaker like 'saught'
        - this also happens around the consonants 'r', 'q', and 'h'

* a, aa, i, ii, u, uu - Long/Short Vowels
    - A repeated vowel just means you say the vowel longer
    - {a: open mouth (lowered tongue and unrounded lips), i: raised tongue, u: rounded lips}

French:

* E - Accute accent
    - Like "ay" in "play"

* s -
    - Sometimes this is translated from a "c" with a diacritic called a cedilla instead of from an "s"
    - Pronounced just how you'd expect (like  in "sight" and "chrysalis"), but I'm noting it here because of tthe change in spelling

* {ALL OTHER DIACRITICS} - I just removed the diacritic

* {LIGATURES} - Have been rendered as two separate charactes, like "ae" and "oe"

Hawai'ian:

* ' - Okina - Glottal Stop

* r, R, RH - Trill or Tap
    - These rhorics (r-sounds) are usually pronounced with a tap or trill of the tongue
    - A tap is often made in English when saying the word 'butter' really fast

    - Taps and trills are also how r's are pronounced in Spanish!
        - An example of a tap is in "pero" (translation: "but")
        - An example of a trill is in "perro" (translation:"dog")

* c, ch - Cha cha cha!
    - These make the "ch" sound, like in "charm"
        - This means that "cat" would be pronounced like the English word "chat"
    - Add extra air to make "ch" (see Aspiration above)

* a, aa, i, ii, u, uu - "Long/Short Vowels"
    - Historically, a repeated vowel often mean you say the vowel longer
    - These days we more often just say the vowel differently: {a: cut, aa: caught, i: dip, ii: deep, u: run, uu: room }

* e, ee, o, oo, - "Diphthongs"
    - Historically, the "e" and "o" sounds were dipthongs

    - It depends on the word, and sometimes just how you feel that day!

Spanish:

* A, E, I, O, U - Accented Vowels! - Raise the pitch on this syllable

* ny, gw - 
    - These are pronounced just how you'd expect (like  in "canyon" and "Gwendolyn"), but I'm noting them here because in Spanish they have special diacritics
